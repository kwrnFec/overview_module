# Elysium Solutions Product Detail Service
An application for dirtbag (and non-dirtbag) climbers and outdoors enthusiasts!

![cryptocurrency-charting-tool-demo](dirtbag-companion.gif)

This single page mini app is here to serve the user by providing them with general information about fifty of some of the most popular routes in the Boulder outdoor climbing scene. Each route has a star rating representing it's popularity amongst people who have climbed it, the route's grade, the type of route it is, how many pitches there are on it, about 3-5 images of the route, usually including the crux, and a detailed description about it, sometimes including higher level beta. (don't worry, nothing too specific that it would spoil the fun!) Dirtbag Companion also includes a side bar that contains all of the available routes that the user is able to click on and see all of the information about that route. Dirtbag Companion is still currently being worked on and the user can expect more features and styles to continue to be updated and implemented. The master branch of this repo, will always have a working version of the codebase! Thank you so much for viewing and I hope you dirtbag climbers (and non dirtbag climbers alike) enjoy!
